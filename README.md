# Barcode App

Just simple Barcode Scanner App.
The user can read the barcodes with a reader. After reading the barcode, the user can decide whether to save it or not. After saving, the barcode appears in the list. The user can remove the barcode (then the snackbar also pops up). The list of barcodes and dates are saved in the device memory, thanks to which it is not cleaned after each application restart. (Hydrated BLoC, not SharedPreferences!!!)
